# Code Standards — Toolkit

The code standard for `godot-mcp-toolkit`, the Godot 4.x editor-plugin / GDScript
half of the project. It does **not** govern the TypeScript server — that repo carries its own
standard.

The document has two parts, and the split is load-bearing:

- **Part I — Portable core** is project-agnostic. It is the set of GDScript and
  Godot-plugin conventions that hold for *any* editor plugin, written so it can be lifted into
  a new plugin as-is. It names this repo's companion documents (a glossary, a contract doc, a
  module taxonomy) only as *optional* alignment points, never as prerequisites.
- **Part II — Project bindings** is this repo's specifics: the `MCPToolkit*` public
  namespace, the nine public classes, the on-disk module taxonomy, the canonical in-tree
  exemplars, and the contract bindings.

**Scope of the general rules.** The general clean-code rules in Part I — naming, formatting,
static typing, comments, and DRY — apply to **all GDScript in the codebase**: the shipped
addon, the `test/` trees, and any tooling script. A file being a test helper or a one-off
script does not lower its readability bar. The genuinely **editor-plugin-specific** rules —
the preload/`class_name` aggregator, the `EditorPlugin` lifecycle, the `@tool` /
editor-runtime / cross-version / export hard gates, Asset-Library hygiene, and god-file
decomposition — are **addon-scoped**: non-addon GDScript is exempt from *those* rules only
because it is not an addon, not because it earns a lower-quality bar. Test scripts are held to
the general rules like every other file.

**On conflict, the hard gates win.** Several addon rules deliberately *deviate* from the base
Godot style guide because the addon runs inside the editor process and ships in export
templates. Those deviations live in [§8 — Godot editor-plugin hard gates](#8-godot-editor-plugin-hard-gates),
and they override stylistic preference wherever the two collide. Each is driven by a concrete
engine bug, an export-template failure mode, a multi-version API gap, or a security boundary at an OS sink.

# Part I — Portable core

## 1. File, folder, and symbol naming

1.1 **Files and folders are `snake_case`.** A named class converts its PascalCase `class_name`
to the snake_case of that name for the filename. *Rationale: cross-platform
case-insensitive-filesystem safety plus Godot convention.* So `class_name MyToolWidget` lives
in `my_tool_widget.gd`, not `MyToolWidget.gd`.

1.2 **Identifier casing** (the base guide, followed verbatim):

| Kind | Case |
|---|---|
| `class_name` / node types / type names | PascalCase |
| Functions / variables | snake_case |
| Signals (past tense) | snake_case |
| Constants | CONSTANT_CASE |
| Enum *name* / enum *members* | PascalCase / CONSTANT_CASE |
| Private / virtual members | leading `_` |

1.3 **Leading underscore means "internal / not API".** Use it for private variables and
private methods. Built-in virtuals (`_enter_tree`, `_ready`, `_process`, `_exit_tree`) keep
their engine-defined underscore. *Rationale: GDScript has no `private` keyword, so the `_`
prefix is the visibility marker.*

1.4 **Signals are named in the past tense** for state changes (`door_opened`). Where the name
describes an *event* rather than a state transition it should still read naturally
(`command_received`, `client_connected`).

### 1.5 Names are intent-revealing, unambiguous, and spelled out

This is a general clean-code rule, codebase-wide — every `.gd`, addon and test alike. A
single-letter or cryptic identifier (a bare `h` for a passed-in object, a `mgr`/`ctx`/`reg`)
is non-conforming everywhere **unless** it is a tight, conventional local: a loop index
`i`/`j`, a math coordinate `x`/`y`/`z`. "It's only test code" is not an exemption.

1. **No unexplained abbreviations — spell out intent, even at the cost of length.** A
   file/class/const/alias name uses whole words, not contractions a reader must already know.
   Expand domain/protocol acronyms in the *name* (`json_rpc_…`, not `rpc_…`). A longer name and
   longer preload path is the accepted trade for a name that reads correctly on first
   encounter. Established, widely-understood initialisms tied to a documented public surface are
   allowed; a private internal `rpc`/`mgr`/`ctx` is not.
2. **Intent revelation.** The name states *what it is or does* in its domain. Bare grab-bag
   tokens (`Helpers`, `Utils`, `Manager`, `Handler`) are allowed only with a domain qualifier
   that says *which* domain (`CommandHelpers`, `LogHelpers`, `VersionUtils`), never alone.
3. **Disambiguation.** No two unrelated concepts share a confusable name, and no
   near-homograph pair lives in one folder. Do not pair a `*registry*` with a `*registrar*`
   (they read identically) — name a one-shot enumerator for its job (a *builder*/*loader*/
   *installer*), not a "registrar". Reserve a word like "Registry" for a genuine store.
4. **Observer-verb convention.** Distinguish observer kinds by verb: a `*_monitor` *observes
   ongoing state* and emits a re-resolve signal; a `*_watcher` reconciles via a filesystem or
   hot-reload signal; a `*_detector` *edge-detects a transition* (`playtest_end_detector`). Do
   not name an edge-detector a "watcher".
5. **Avoid engine-type and cross-role collisions.** A `class_name` never shadows a Godot type;
   a renamed file never takes the base name of the engine header it `extends` (not
   `editor_debugger_plugin.gd`). Internal names avoid words that already denote a *different*
   architectural role elsewhere in the project.
6. **Folder carries domain.** A file inside a bounded-context folder need not repeat the
   domain — but its class/alias must still be self-disambiguating when read *without* the path,
   because a hub alias is read as `<Hub>.<Alias>` with no folder context.

A grab-bag name like `Helpers` is often also a cohesion smell ([§7](#7-design-solid-cohesion-and-decomposition)),
but the rename and the structural split are separate fixes — one fixes the name, the other
fixes the structure. *If your project maintains a glossary, align every public name to its
canonical term.*

## 2. Mandatory declaration order

Every script orders its members top-to-bottom exactly as the style guide prescribes, so a
reader always finds each kind of member in the same place. Source: GDScript style guide → "Code
order".

```
01. @tool / @icon / @static_unload          (annotations)
02. class_name
03. extends
04. ## docstring (class documentation comment)
05. signals
06. enums
07. constants
08. static variables
09. @export variables
10. regular variables
11. @onready variables
12. _static_init()
13. other static methods
14. built-in virtuals, in this order:
       _init → _enter_tree → _ready → _process → _physics_process → (other virtuals)
15. overridden custom methods
16. remaining methods
17. inner classes
```

**2.1 Inner classes — type-before-use exception.** The guide places inner classes *last*.
GDScript requires a type to be declared before use in the same file, so when a member variable
is typed by an inner class, that inner class must appear **above** the variable. Allow an inner
class to sit immediately above its first use as a documented exception; prefer last placement
when no such constraint exists.

---

## 3. Formatting

3.1 **Tabs for indentation** (never spaces), one level deeper than the enclosing block.

3.2 **Continuation indentation:** two levels for wrapped function arguments; one level for
wrapped arrays / dicts / enums.

3.3 **~100-column soft guideline.** Keep lines under 100 characters where practical. This is
advisory, not a hard gate — never break a user-facing string literal (a hint string, an error
message) just to satisfy it.

3.4 **One statement per line** (the ternary is the sole exception). No `if x: return y`.
*Rationale: debuggability plus clean diffs.*

3.5 **Two blank lines** between functions and between class-level definitions; one blank line
to separate logical blocks inside a function.

3.6 **One space around operators and after commas.** Spaces inside single-line dict braces:
`{ key = "value" }`.

3.7 **Trailing commas** in multi-line arrays / dicts / enums / call argument lists.
*Rationale: clean diffs when the next element is added.*

3.8 **Prefer English boolean keywords** `and` / `or` / `not` over `&&` / `||` / `!`.

3.9 **Double quotes by default**; single quotes only when they reduce escaping.

---

## 4. Static typing

Source: <https://docs.godotengine.org/en/stable/tutorials/scripting/gdscript/static_typing.html>

4.1 **Type every function signature** — typed parameters and an explicit return type
(`-> Type`, or `-> void`). *Rationale: compile-time error detection, autocompletion, and
optimized opcodes.*

4.2 **Prefer `:=` inference when the type is obvious on the same line**; use an explicit
`: Type` when the right-hand side is ambiguous (results of `get()`, `call()`, dynamic dispatch,
or `Variant` JSON values).

4.3 **Type collections where it adds safety:** `Array[String]`, `Array[int]`,
`Array[WebSocketPeer]`. **Do not** use typed `Dictionary[K, V]` — it is 4.4+ only (see
[§8.3](#83-cross-version-compatibility)); use plain `Dictionary` for cross-version JSON
payloads. Typed `Array[...]` is fine (4.0+).

4.4 **Untyped `Variant` / plain `Dictionary` is correct at the JSON-RPC boundary.** Command
handlers receive `parameters: Dictionary` and return `Dictionary` because the payload is
dynamically typed JSON; do not force false precision there. At these boundaries, bare `var`
with `=` (not `:=`) is the correct choice precisely because the value is `Variant`.

4.5 **Avoid `as` for validation.** `as` silently yields `null` on mismatch and can hide bugs.
Validate explicitly instead of trusting a silent cast.

---

## 5. Comments and documentation

Comments split into two tiers: **doc comments** (`##`) the editor harvests into the in-editor
class reference, and **ordinary comments** (`#`) for implementation notes. The general
philosophy below governs both; [§5.11](#511-the-gdscript--godot-doc-comment-layer) adds the
GDScript/Godot doc-comment specifics on top. Where a Godot convention and a general rule
collide, **the Godot convention wins** — it keeps contributors familiar with the engine.

Each rule carries a confidence flag distilled from the canonical literature and the major
adopted style guides: **[STRONG]** = near-universal · **[common]** = widely held ·
**[contested]** = guidance, not law.

### 5.1 Core principle — intent (the "why"), never history

Code already says *what* it does and *how*; a comment earns its place by saying *why* — the
rationale, the non-obvious constraint, the hazard, the contract a reader can't infer. Two
corollaries:

1. **Why, not what/how.** A comment that restates the next line earns nothing and rots into a
   lie. Comment the *surprising*, not the *obvious*. [STRONG]
2. **Intent, not history.** A comment is self-contained intent for the reader of *this* code,
   not a development log. When it changed, which ticket or iteration produced it, who debated it
   — that belongs in version control, commit messages, and decision records. The comment carries
   the *resulting* intent, rewritten so it stands alone. [STRONG]

```
# ✗ retry 3 times
# ✓ retry 3×: the upstream load-balancer drops the first request after an idle period
```

### 5.2 What a comment is for (the high-value categories)

Write a comment when — and largely only when — it does one of these:

- **Intent / rationale** — *why* this approach, and why the obvious alternatives were rejected.
  The most durable category; structurally unrecoverable from code. [STRONG]
- **Warning of consequences** — hazards the code can't enforce (`# not thread-safe — call only
  from the main loop`; `# O(n²); fine for the fixed menu, never on user data`). Often the
  highest-value comment in a file. [STRONG]
- **Amplification** — flag a detail that looks trivial or removable but isn't, so a future
  "cleanup" doesn't reintroduce a bug (`# the trailing trim is required — the firmware appends a
  NUL byte`). [common]
- **Clarification of the unidiomatic** — explain a deliberate workaround or perf trick so it
  isn't "simplified" away. [common]
- **Invariants, assumptions, preconditions** — correctness conditions the syntax can't express.
  [STRONG]
- **Precision the type can't give** — units, value ranges, null/empty semantics, inclusive vs
  exclusive boundaries (`# timeout in milliseconds; 0 disables (not "instant")`). [STRONG]
- **A stable external reference** — a public issue/bug/PR link, a spec, an RFC, when the
  authoritative rationale lives outside the repo. Phrase it as *intent + constraint*, not
  narration (see [§5.4](#54-intent-not-development-history)). [common]

### 5.3 Express intent in the code first

The cheapest, most reliable comment is the one the code made unnecessary.

- **Prefer self-explanatory code over a comment.** A well-named `is_overdue()` beats
  `# check if overdue`; names and types are compiler-checked and never drift. [STRONG]
- **A comment needed to explain confusing code is a smell — refactor first.** If a block needs
  a paragraph to be understood, the fix is usually extraction or a better name. "Don't comment
  bad code — rewrite it." [STRONG]
- **"Self-documenting code" is the goal, not a licence to omit the *why*.** Names and structure
  carry *what/how*; they cannot carry rationale, rejected alternatives, or hazards. The
  consensus is quality over quantity. [contested]
- **Comment at a different level of abstraction than the code** — go *lower* (precision) or
  *higher* (intent); a same-level comment just echoes the code. [STRONG]

### 5.4 Intent, not development history

Comments are read by strangers reading *this* code; they are not a changelog.

- **Keep process history out of source.** No edit journals, no "changed by … on …", no
  sprint/iteration/ticket narration, no "we decided this during review." Version control records
  who/when/what far better, and the in-source log only rots. Rewrite the *resulting* intent
  inline; relocate the narrative rationale to commit messages and decision records. [STRONG]

  ```
  # ✗ Added in sprint 14 (TICKET-882); reworked after the Apr review — see decision log #7
  # ✓ Serialised single-file to avoid the torn-write race when two writers share the path
  ```

- **Keep load-bearing external references — rephrased as intent + constraint.** A *public*
  bug/PR link or spec reference that explains why this code must exist (or must not be
  "simplified") stays at the site, written as intent. Test: would a contributor with *only this
  repository* understand the why? If a reference is private or unreachable, inline enough context
  to stand alone, or drop it. [common]

  ```
  # ✓ work around <upstream/repo#1234>: the API returns stale data until the next frame, so re-read
  ```

- **No attribution or authorship tags** (`@author`, "created by") — version history owns that,
  and the tag is stale the moment someone else edits. [common]

### 5.5 Documenting the public surface

- **Document every public / exported symbol** — module, type, public function/method, public
  field/enum. Public doc comments feed generated docs and onboard contributors. [STRONG]
- **A doc comment must let a caller use the item without reading its body** — purpose,
  parameters, return/yield, and failure modes. **Document cross-module contracts where they're
  defined** (return shapes, invariants); they are the de-facto API between modules. [STRONG]
- **Document intent and contract, never types.** The signature already carries the types;
  repeating them is pure redundancy. Describe *meaning, units, contract*. [STRONG]

  ```
  # ✗ @param count  the integer count
  # ✓ count: items to take from the head; clamped to the buffer length
  ```

- **Lead with a one-line summary; defer depth** into the detail slot. [STRONG]
- **Give non-obvious public APIs a runnable example** — the fastest contract a user reads.
  Favour *clear* over *realistic*. [common]
- **Cross-reference instead of duplicating** — link a related symbol rather than re-describing
  it; one fact, one home. [STRONG]
- **Mark deprecations with the dedicated tag and name the replacement.** [common]
- **Internal/private comments are need-based, not mandatory.** Keep implementation detail out of
  the public docs. [STRONG]
- **Where the ecosystem supports it, make the public-API-doc requirement machine-enforced** so
  docs don't drift as the API grows. [common]

### 5.6 Anti-patterns (delete on sight)

- **Redundant / parrot comments** that restate the code (`i += 1  # add one`). Delete; rename
  the symbol if the intent was unclear. [STRONG]
- **Misleading / outdated comments ("rot")** — a stale comment is *worse than none*: the reader
  trusts it and builds on a false premise. [STRONG]
- **Commented-out / zombie code** — delete it; version control remembers. [STRONG]
- **Journal / changelog comments** in source → version control. [STRONG]
- **Noise / mumbling** — half-finished thoughts, decorative filler. Resolve or cut. [STRONG]
- **Banner / position-marker overuse** — heavy dividers usually signal the unit does too much
  (extract instead). If used at all, one agreed format, no ASCII-art boxes. [common]
- **Closing-brace / block-end comments** (`# end if`) — a crutch for over-long blocks; extract
  a function. [STRONG]
- **Over-commenting trivial code** — dilutes the rare comment that matters. [STRONG]
- **Apology / excuse comments** ("ugly hack, no time") — fix it or file a tracked issue and
  reference it. [common]
- **Vague or imprecise comments** — if you can't say it clearly, don't. [STRONG]
- **Caller / consumer enumerations** — a comment listing *who calls* the unit (`Used by X and
  Y`, `Called by plugin.gd`). The roster rots the instant a caller is added or renamed, and it
  duplicates what a reference search answers authoritatively. State the unit's **role and
  contract**, not its callers. Keep a consumer reference only when it is *load-bearing context
  the caller can't otherwise know* — e.g. "the runtime autoload preloads this, so keep it
  editor-clean" (a *constraint*, not a roster). [STRONG]

  ```
  # ✗ Used by command_registry.gd and extension_loader.gd to filter version-gated commands
  # ✓ Engine-version comparison helpers for version-gated command registration
  ```

### 5.7 TODO / FIXME and friends

- **Use a small, fixed, greppable marker set** with defined meanings (`TODO` = planned work,
  `FIXME` = known-broken, `HACK` = brittle). Keep the set short. [common]
- **Every marker is actionable + attributable + tracked** — state *what* and *why*, and
  reference a tracking issue where one exists: `TODO(<issue-or-owner>): <description>`. Track the
  real work in the issue tracker, not in source. [STRONG on the marker]
- **Bind time/condition-dependent markers to a concrete trigger** ("remove when all clients send
  v2") — "someday" TODOs never resolve. [common]
- **Scan markers in CI** so orphans surface and get triaged. [common]

### 5.8 Open-source hygiene (comments are public)

- **Never put secrets in comments** — keys, tokens, passwords, private endpoints. Public repos
  are scanned by bots within minutes of a push. [STRONG]
- **No internal-only URLs, absolute developer paths, or unreachable names** — contributors can't
  use them and they leak internal topology. [common]
- **Make ticket references resolvable** — a public tracker, or inline enough context to stand
  alone. [common]
- **Use an SPDX `SPDX-License-Identifier:` header, not a full licence blurb per file** —
  machine-readable, travels with the file, no per-file drift; full text lives once in `LICENSE`.
  [STRONG for OSS]
- **Keep comments professional, inclusive, contributor-facing** — no profanity, snark, blame,
  in-jokes, or non-inclusive terms. [common]
- **Attribute and link copied/adapted code** for licence compliance and provenance. [common]

### 5.9 Keeping comments healthy

- **Update a comment in the same change as the code it describes** — atomically. The one
  discipline that prevents rot. [STRONG]
- **Co-locate a comment with its code** — a detached comment drifts. [STRONG]
- **Treat comment accuracy as a code-review gate** — review that comments are still true and
  carry *why* not *what*. When a reviewer can't follow the code, fix the *code* first. [common]
- **Prefer making the comment unnecessary (refactor-first).** [STRONG]
- **Doc comments are build artifacts, not decoration** — generators consume them; a stale or
  broken doc comment is a defect. [STRONG]
- **Delete dead comments on sight** — zombie code, obsolete TODOs, notes that no longer apply.
  [STRONG]

### 5.10 Relocating stripped rationale

When [§5.4](#54-intent-not-development-history) strips internal narrative rationale out of a
comment, relocate it — to the commit message, to a decision record (ADR), or to the project's
rationale archive — rather than deleting the *thinking*. The comment keeps only the
self-contained *resulting* intent; the narrative trail lives where history belongs. *The
concrete archive mechanism and location are project-specific (see Part II).*

### 5.11 The GDScript / Godot doc-comment layer

The general rules above plus what `##` doc comments, the in-editor Help feed, and Godot
conventions require on top.

5.11.1 **`##` documentation comments** describe classes and public members and feed the
in-editor help (Help / F1). Place the class docstring immediately after `extends` (declaration
order slot 04, [§2](#2-mandatory-declaration-order)).

5.11.2 **`#` for regular comments**, starting with a space. `#region` / `#endregion` markers
take no leading space. (Prefer deleting commented-out code over preserving it,
[§5.6](#56-anti-patterns-delete-on-sight).)

5.11.3 **`##` on `static func` helpers that other modules call** — document the dict-shaped
return contract in the docstring (e.g. `## Returns {"ok": true, "value": <coerced>} on
success.`). These return shapes are the de-facto API between modules; document them where
they're defined.

5.11.4 **Section banners.** A `# -- Title ----` banner can chunk a long file into navigable
sections, substituting for folding regions. Use sparingly and with one agreed format — heavy
banners usually mean the unit does too much and wants extraction
([§5.6](#56-anti-patterns-delete-on-sight)).

5.11.5 **Public-API documentation is mandatory and exemplary.** The public `class_name` types
are the surface Godot auto-generates into the in-editor class reference, so **every public
member** — method, signal, constant, enum, and `@export` var — carries a `##` doc comment.
Depth scales with the member: a one-line brief for a trivial accessor; full parameter/return
prose plus a `[codeblock]` example for a primary entry point. *Internal* (preload-only)
scripts are not in the auto-generated reference, so they carry **at minimum a one-line
class-level `##` brief** plus the cross-module contract docs of 5.11.3 — not the exhaustive
per-member treatment.

5.11.6 **Brief vs. detailed description.** A doc block's **first paragraph is the brief** — the
one-liner shown in lists and tooltips. Separate it from the **detailed** body with a single
blank `##` line (a `##` with nothing after it). Lines within a paragraph are space-joined;
force a break with `[br]`. A block with no blank `##` line is used as both brief and detail.

```gdscript
## Restricts the command to a minimum Godot version.
##
## Versions below [param version] skip registration. Format is "major.minor"
## or "major.minor.patch"; an invalid format warns and is ignored.
func with_min_godot_version(version: String) -> MCPToolkitCommandOptions:
```

5.11.7 **Document parameters and return in prose — there is no `@param`/`@returns` in
GDScript.** Reference each parameter with `[param name]` and state the result with a "Returns
…" sentence. Never restate the signature's types (the signature carries them); describe
meaning, units, and contract.

5.11.8 **BBCode vocabulary — floored to Godot 4.2.** Doc comments are read on every supported
editor down to the 4.2 floor, so use only tags that render there:

- **Cross-references:** `[ClassName]`, `[param]`, `[member]`, `[method]`, `[signal]`,
  `[constant]`, `[enum]`, `[annotation]`.
- **Formatting:** `[b]`, `[i]`, `[u]`, `[code]`, `[codeblock]` (plain), `[br]`, `[url]`,
  `[kbd]`.

  **Forbidden** (4.3+ forms — they render as literal text in a 4.2 editor's doc popup,
  degrading the reference): `[codeblock lang=…]` (use plain `[codeblock]`), `[lb]` / `[rb]`,
  `[constructor]`, `[operator]`. Doc-comment content never affects compilation, so static
  validation cannot catch a violation — this rule is review-enforced (verify by viewing the
  rendered reference in the editor).

5.11.9 **`@`-tags.** `@tutorial(Title): URL` links an external guide. Mark API status with the
**bare** `@deprecated` / `@experimental` only — the `@deprecated: message` /
`@experimental: message` forms are 4.3+ (5.11.8); put the explanation in the description prose
and keep the bare tag for the badge.

5.11.10 **Give non-obvious public entry points a `[codeblock]` example** — the fastest contract
a caller reads. Favour clear over realistic; keep it 4.2-safe (plain `[codeblock]`).

---

## 6. Preloads, `class_name`, and the preload aggregator

6.1 **Prefer `const X := preload(...)` over `class_name` for plugin-internal scripts.**
`class_name` registers globally — it pollutes the user's autocomplete, "Add Node" dialog, and
type hints with names they never need. Reserve `class_name` for types the **end user**
legitimately touches.

6.2 **`class_name` is reserved for the public extension API and shared value types** — the
types an extension author or the dispatch contract needs globally. Everything else (commands,
helpers, monitors, sync) is preload-only.

6.3 **Centralize internal preloads in one aggregator.** A single `extends RefCounted`
aggregator script holds every internal script path as a `const Name := preload(...)`; other
files reach them through one `const <Hub> := preload(".../<aggregator>.gd")` and reference
`<Hub>.FileGuard`, etc. *Rationale: script paths live in one place — if a file moves, update
the aggregator and nothing else.*

6.4 **Two re-export forms, by intent.** When pulling a symbol *through* the aggregator, use
`:=` for a direct preload the file owns, and `=` (untyped) when re-exporting an aggregator
member whose type GDScript can't infer at parse time. The `=` form is required there, not
sloppiness.

6.5 **Beware aggregator cycles.** A file that the aggregator itself preloads must **not**
preload the aggregator back (circular dependency). Leaf helpers that the aggregator collects use
direct `preload()`, never the aggregator, and say so inline.

---

## 7. Design: SOLID, cohesion, and decomposition

The rules below are the SOLID and Clean-Code grounding applied to GDScript — most sharply the
**single-responsibility principle**, supported by cohesion, DRY, and command/query separation;
the remaining SOLID principles (open/closed, Liskov substitution, interface segregation,
dependency inversion) are the background grounding the same rules serve. Cohesion is a property
of the **whole tree**, not of one class in isolation: apply the *same* decomposition pattern
everywhere so a contributor recognises one shape in every subsystem.

7.1 **One statable responsibility per file (file-level SRP).** A `.gd` file should have a single
reason to change. *Test:* if you can't write a crisp one-paragraph "this file does X" *without
"and"*, it is a decomposition candidate. *Rationale: a file you can't spec in a sentence is one
a reader can't hold in their head.*

7.2 **Orchestrator + SRP-children is the standard decomposition.** When a subsystem outgrows one
responsibility, split it into a thin **orchestrator** that constructs, wires, and sequences,
plus a set of single-responsibility **child** modules it composes. The orchestrator owns
lifecycle and delegation, **not** domain logic. *Rationale: one shape for every god-file fix, so
the reader learns it once.*

7.3 **When to split — guidance, not a hard line.** Any one of these is a smell; the combination
is decisive: (a) more than one statable responsibility (7.1); (b) the section banners are really
separating *distinct* responsibilities, not chunks of one; (c) the file mixes editor-only and
runtime-reachable code (the static-graph split in
[§8.2](#82-editorruntime-split-by-the-static-dependency-graph-not-runtime-branches) forces a split anyway). **Size is
a secondary signal only** — a long *cohesive* file (one large command module that does one
thing) is fine, and size alone never forces a split. *Responsibility count, not line count, is
the metric.*

7.4 **DRY — extract one helper for any shape or decision built ≥ 2×.** If the same dict shape,
validation, or branch logic appears in two or more places, extract a single helper and call it
from each site. *Rationale: a duplicated shape is a latent contract that drifts; one builder both
removes the duplication and enforces the invariant in one place.* **Rule of three:** incidental
similarity *expected to diverge* is not duplication — prefer a little repetition over the wrong
abstraction. Extract when the shapes are the *same fact*, not merely look-alikes.

7.5 **Command/Query separation (CQS).** A function or tool either **changes state** or **returns
data**, not both. *Rationale: a read folded into a mutating verb hides the read from callers and
the routing layer.* Extract a read action smuggled inside a mutating verb into its own dedicated
read tool.

7.6 **Decomposed children inherit the editor/runtime discipline.** Splitting a runtime-reachable
file must **not** introduce an editor-only symbol into the runtime preload closure
([§8.2](#82-editorruntime-split-by-the-static-dependency-graph-not-runtime-branches)). Every extracted child of a
runtime-reachable module stays export-clean. *Decomposition is a refactor — it cannot quietly
re-taint the static graph.*

7.7 **Uniformity, with documented exceptions.** Apply this section consistently so every
subsystem reads the same way. Deviations are allowed case-by-case but must be **deliberate and
documented** — an inline comment at the site, or a noted exception in this standard (the same
mechanism 1.1 / 2.1 / 3.4 use).

7.8 **Folder topology is the decomposition made visible — main actor at the domain-folder root,
sub-actors in subdomain child folders.** Group the addon tree into **bounded-context domain
folders**; inside each, the **orchestrator sits at the folder root** and the **sub-actors it
composes live in child folders, divided by subdomain.** This is the on-disk shape of the 7.2
split — a reader opens one folder and finds the orchestrator beside the collaborators it wires,
so a boundary that is invisible in a flat root becomes self-evident. A decomposition's children
are **born in the right folder**, not created flat and relocated later. *(Cross-refs 1.1
file/folder naming and 1.5.6 "folder carries domain".)*

## 8. Godot editor-plugin hard gates

This is the load-bearing section. Each rule here is driven by a concrete engine bug, an
export-template failure mode, a multi-version API gap, or a security boundary at an OS sink; they are non-negotiable for an `@tool`
addon and **override [§1](#1-file-folder-and-symbol-naming)–[§7](#7-design-solid-cohesion-and-decomposition)
on conflict.**

### 8.1 Universal `@tool`

**Every addon script begins with `@tool`** — helpers, command modules, and the runtime autoload
included. Without `@tool` the editor treats the script as empty, so a preloaded helper silently
no-ops.

### 8.2 Editor/runtime split by the STATIC DEPENDENCY GRAPH (not runtime branches)

A runtime-shipped script (the autoload **and everything it `preload`s**, transitively) must name
**zero** editor-only classes (`EditorInterface`, `EditorPlugin`, `EditorFileSystem`, …).
*Rationale: GDScript resolves identifiers at **parse time**, before any
`Engine.is_editor_hint()` / `OS.has_feature("editor")` runtime guard executes. Naming an editor
class — or `preload`ing a script that does — **parse-fails** the script in an export template
where it ships unstripped (`godotengine/godot#91713`, unfixed across 4.2–4.6). Runtime guards
gate **behavior**, not **parsing**.*

- Adding a `preload` of the editor-tainted aggregator (or of any script that statically names
  `EditorInterface`/`EditorPlugin`) to the runtime autoload, or to any script it pulls in, taints
  the whole closure.
- **Review test:** trace the autoload's full preload closure; if any node in that graph
  references an editor-only symbol, it is a defect. Behavior guards
  (`if Engine.is_editor_hint(): return`) are still required *inside* the autoload to stop it
  *running* in the editor — but they are not a substitute for keeping the **graph** clean.

The "silent-if-shipped" norm matches mature addons (Beehave, Dialogue Manager).

### 8.3 Cross-version compatibility

Target the **oldest supported version (4.2)** and feature-detect upward. Plugins are
**forward-incompatible** (a plugin that calls a 4.5 API won't load in 4.4), so never call a
newer API unconditionally.

- **Dynamic dispatch for version-gated methods:** prefer `obj.has_method("foo")` +
  `obj.call("foo", …)` over a direct call when the method is absent in some supported version.
  (Examples: `EditorInterface.close_scene` is 4.5+; `get_editor_toaster` is 4.4+.)
- **Don't form a `Callable` from a bare static-method reference.** On Godot **4.2 only**, the
  compiler binds a bare member-function reference to `SELF`; inside a `static` function `SELF` is
  `NIL`, so the call silently aborts (`Invalid get index '<method>' (on base: 'Nil')`) and returns a
  typed-default value **with no error propagated** — a silent wrong result on 4.2, correct on 4.3+.
  Fixed upstream between 4.2 and 4.5 (`gdscript_compiler.cpp` SELF→CLASS for static members).
  **Instead:** pass the resolved value directly (e.g. the `Node`), or inject an instance method.
  Guarded by a headless 4.2 unit test.
- **Typed `Dictionary[K, V]` is 4.4+ only** — do not use it; use plain `Dictionary`
  ([§4.3](#4-static-typing)). Typed `Array[...]` is fine (4.0+).
- **Centralize version comparisons** in one version-utility module (an `is_at_least` /
  `is_at_most` / `is_version_in_range` set) rather than hand-rolling string compares at each
  call site.
- **Warn, don't block, on untested-newer engines** — push a warning above the latest tested
  version but run anyway.

### 8.4 No `OS.delay_msec()` / `OS.delay_usec()` in command handlers

These **block the editor main thread** — UI, rendering, and input all freeze for the duration.
Use `await Engine.get_main_loop().create_timer(seconds).timeout` instead; it yields control back
to the engine so the editor stays responsive. *The dispatch system `await`s every handler, so
coroutine handlers work transparently.* **Exemption:** low-level infrastructure where
millisecond blocking is intentional and off the command-handler path (e.g. a file-lock retry).

### 8.5 EditorPlugin lifecycle and teardown symmetry

- **`_enter_tree()` registers; `_exit_tree()` unregisters in reverse order.** Every `add_*` has
  a matching `remove_*` — leaked registrations error on the next editor launch.
- **Autoload registration goes in `_enable_plugin()` / `_disable_plugin()`**, not
  `_enter_tree()` — those fire on plugin *toggle*, not on every editor start, so the autoload
  entry isn't re-added each launch.
- **Free owned scenes/controls you instantiated.** Removing a control from a dock does **not**
  free it.
- **Disconnect signals explicitly in teardown.** Editor singletons
  (`EditorFileSystem.filesystem_changed`, `ProjectSettings.settings_changed`) outlive the plugin
  instance; an undisconnected callback becomes a zombie. Check `is_connected` then `disconnect`.
- **GDScript 2.0 signal syntax only:** `sig.connect(callable)`, never the 3.x
  `connect("sig", self, "method")` string form (it silently fails in 4.x).

### 8.6 Plugin teardown frees with `free()`, not `queue_free()`

In `_exit_tree`, free owned objects with **immediate `free()`** so their script / preload
reference chains release **before** ObjectDB's exit-time leak check runs. `queue_free()` defers
deletion to *after* that check, producing spurious "resources still in use at exit" errors. Clear
the command registry first to break the `Callable → GDScript` chains. **Caveat:** `RefCounted`
subsystems (export plugin, debugger hook, watchers) are **not** freed at all — just null the
reference after the matching `remove_*`; they collect when the last ref drops. *This deviates
from generic `queue_free()` advice — the editor-exit leak check is the reason.*

### 8.7 Discard + recreate a `TCPServer` after a failed `listen()`

A `TCPServer` instance that failed to bind **latches `ERR_ALREADY_IN_USE`** if you retry
`listen()` on the same instance. On any bind failure, call `stop()` and null the reference, then
create a fresh `TCPServer` for the next attempt. *Reusing the latched instance never recovers; a
fresh instance does.*

### 8.8 Heavy editor I/O is deferred and frame-throttled

Polling the TCP/WebSocket listener runs via `call_deferred` (out of the `_process` call stack)
and only every Nth frame, to dodge a documented engine reentrancy race between plugin `_process`
work and FileSystem-dock-triggered main-loop work (`godotengine/godot#46893`, `#54864`,
`#110891`). *Rule: don't move listener/scene I/O back inline into `_process`; it reproduces
editor crashes.* Included here so a reviewer doesn't "simplify" it away.

### 8.9 Check the `send_text` return — oversized WebSocket frames drop wholesale

A `WebSocketPeer.send_text()` frame larger than the peer's `outbound_buffer_size` is **rejected
whole** (`ERR_OUT_OF_MEMORY`, no chunking) — stable 4.2–4.5. An unchecked send therefore drops an
oversized response **silently**: the client sees a hung or closed request, not an error. Check
the `Error` return on every response send, and size-guard the payload at **one central
choke-point** in the send/dispatch path so an over-budget response becomes an actionable error
(a `RESPONSE_TOO_LARGE` code plus a "narrow the query / paginate / raise the buffer" hint) instead
of a silent hang. The same return check applies to fire-and-forget notification sends — at minimum
`push_warning` on a dropped frame so it is visible. *A silent wholesale drop is the hardest
transport failure to diagnose.*

### 8.10 Custom ProjectSettings / EditorSettings

- **After registering a setting, call `set_as_basic(key, true)`** so it shows without the
  "Advanced Settings" toggle (custom settings are hidden by default).
- **Register with `add_property_info` + `set_initial_value`** for a typed, inspector-friendly
  entry; guard creation with `has_setting` so re-runs don't clobber user values.
- **Machine-personal preferences go in `EditorSettings`, not `ProjectSettings`.** A per-user /
  per-machine choice (battery, CPU, dock visibility) must never be committed to `project.godot` /
  VCS — register it under `EditorInterface.get_editor_settings()`.
- **Watch `config/name` for `user://` path shifts.** If the addon stores state under `user://`,
  a project rename orphans it and can flood the console; re-derive paths on change.
- **Unregister settings on uninstall — never on reload.** Scrub custom `ProjectSettings` keys in
  `_disable_plugin` (the uninstall path), **not** in `_exit_tree` (which fires on every reload,
  where the user's config must survive). Null them by **prefix-scanning** the live property list
  for the addon's namespace rather than nulling a hardcoded key list — a scan stays correct as
  keys come and go. Machine-wide `EditorSettings` are shared by every project, so **prompt before
  erasing** them.

### 8.11 `static func` utility modules

- **Stateless helpers are `static func` on a `RefCounted` script**, called without instantiation
  through the preload const. *No lifecycle, no allocation, no instance to thread through — pure
  functions namespaced by their script.*
- **Command modules expose a single `static func register(registry, server)` entry point** that
  adds the module's commands to the registry as Callables. *Uniform, data-driven registration;
  one place sees the full command surface.*

### 8.12 Asset-Library shipping hygiene

- **`plugin.cfg` carries only the documented fields** (`name`, `description`, `author`,
  `version`, `script`). Godot reads no others; version compatibility is declared in the Asset
  Library form, not here.
- **The plugin-id folder name is frozen after first release** — user data references the path.
- **Shipped addon files must be self-contained.** Files under the shipped addon folder must not
  reference paths that don't ship (design docs, ADRs, deep-dive analyses). Those live *outside*
  the shipped tree and may reference each other freely.
- **Ship the Godot-4 sidecar metadata — never strip or git-ignore `.uid` / `.import`.** Godot
  4.4+ `.uid` files (and the 4.x `.import` files for imported assets) carry each resource's stable
  `uid://` identity. They are **project state, not generated output**, and for a *distributed*
  addon they must travel **with** the addon — otherwise `uid://` references into it break when a
  user updates the addon in an existing project. Keep them git-tracked, never delete them in a
  release/build script, and never `export-ignore` them, so **every** channel ships byte-identical
  sidecars. *(Pre-4.4 editors ignore `.uid` harmlessly — safe across the whole 4.2+ floor.)*

### 8.13 Validate a data-derived URL's scheme before `OS.shell_open`

A URL that originates from untrusted or remote-fetched data (a downloaded catalog, a
maintainer-supplied link, any `res://` an adversary could rewrite) must have its scheme validated
against an allowlist (`http` / `https`) before it is passed to `OS.shell_open` or any OS handoff. An
attacker-controlled scheme (`file:`, `javascript:`, a custom handler) reaching an OS sink is an
input-validation boundary breach — reject, don't open, anything outside the allowlist. *Rationale:
the OS handler, not the editor, decides what a non-`http` scheme does; the allowlist keeps an
untrusted link from steering it.*

# Part II — Project bindings

This part records what is specific to *this* repo: the public namespace, the module taxonomy,
the canonical in-tree exemplars, and the contract bindings. Part I's rules are the law; this part
is where they touch concrete files. Paths are relative to the toolkit repo root.

## B1. The `MCPToolkit*` public namespace and the nine public classes

Per [§6.2](#6-preloads-class_name-and-the-preload-aggregator), `class_name` is reserved for the
public extension API and shared value types. This repo registers **exactly nine**, all
`MCPToolkit`-prefixed to avoid colliding with user code. Each file's `snake_case` name matches
the snake_case of its `class_name` ([§1.1](#1-file-folder-and-symbol-naming)) — the
`mcp_toolkit_*` filename and the `MCPToolkit*` class are deliberately the same words. Everything
else is preload-only.

| `class_name` | File |
|---|---|
| `MCPToolkitCommandRegistry` | `addons/godot_mcp_toolkit/transport/mcp_toolkit_command_registry.gd` |
| `MCPToolkitCommandOptions` | `addons/godot_mcp_toolkit/contract/mcp_toolkit_command_options.gd` |
| `MCPToolkitError` | `addons/godot_mcp_toolkit/contract/mcp_toolkit_error.gd` |
| `MCPToolkitSuccess` | `addons/godot_mcp_toolkit/contract/mcp_toolkit_success.gd` |
| `MCPToolkitToolContext` | `addons/godot_mcp_toolkit/contract/mcp_toolkit_tool_context.gd` |
| `MCPToolkitSafeSceneOps` | `addons/godot_mcp_toolkit/scene/mcp_toolkit_safe_scene_ops.gd` |
| `MCPToolkitUndoRedoAction` | `addons/godot_mcp_toolkit/scene/mcp_toolkit_undo_redo_action.gd` |
| `MCPToolkitExtension` | `addons/godot_mcp_toolkit/extensions/mcp_toolkit_extension.gd` |
| `MCPToolkitExtensionOptions` | `addons/godot_mcp_toolkit/extensions/mcp_toolkit_extension_options.gd` |

These nine classes are the project's **canonical examples** of the public-API doc standard
([§5.11.5](#511-the-gdscript--godot-doc-comment-layer)): every public member carries a `##` doc
comment, depth scaling with the member.

**Naming specifics that bind [§1.5](#15-names-are-intent-revealing-unambiguous-and-spelled-out):**

- `MCP`, `LSP`, `UID` are the established initialisms tied to the documented public surface
  (1.5.1); a private internal `rpc`/`mgr`/`ctx` is not.
- "Registry" is reserved for two established stores: `MCPToolkitCommandRegistry` (the dispatch
  table) and the machine-wide project/instance store under `registry/` (1.5.3). Introduce no
  third "Registry".
- "bridge" denotes the **server** (the TypeScript MCP bridge) across the two repos; an
  editor-side `EditorDebuggerPlugin` is a *session-tracker* / *hook*, not a "bridge" (1.5.5).
- The preload aggregator ([§6.3](#6-preloads-class_name-and-the-preload-aggregator)) is
  `addons/godot_mcp_toolkit/core/modules.gd`, aliased `Modules` by every consumer
  (`const Modules := preload("res://addons/godot_mcp_toolkit/core/modules.gd")`, e.g.
  `plugin.gd:5`). Members are read as `Modules.FileGuard`, `Modules.VersionUtils`,
  `Modules.EditorAccess`, etc.

## B2. Module taxonomy (the on-disk decomposition)

The addon follows the folder topology of [§7.8](#7-design-solid-cohesion-and-decomposition): a
bounded-context domain folder per subsystem, the orchestrator at the folder root, sub-actors in
subdomain child folders. The addon root holds only the entry point, `plugin.gd`.

| Domain folder | Orchestrator / root | Subdomain children |
|---|---|---|
| `transport/` | `mcp_server.gd` | `transport/dispatch/` (`dispatch_lane`, `mutation_watchdog`, `server_request_router`); also `ws_transport.gd`, `notifier.gd`, `debug_bridge.gd`, `builtin_command_registration.gd` |
| `registry/` | `registry_client.gd` | `registry/store/` (`file_lock`, `registry_entry_file`, `registry_paths`, `registry_projection`) |
| `extensions/` | `extension_loader.gd` | `extensions/services/` (`extension_discovery`, `extension_meta_commands`, `extension_support`, `extension_watcher`) |
| `commands/` | the per-domain command modules | `commands/{editor,tileset,playtest}/` |
| `ui/dock/` | `dock.gd` | `ui/dock/{ext,limits,mcp,security,status}/` |
| `contract/` | the value types + `coerce.gd` | — |
| `core/` | `plugin_composer.gd`, `modules.gd` (the aggregator) | `editor_access.gd`, `settings_registration.gd`, `tool_menu.gd`, `disable_cleanup_coordinator.gd`, `export_strip.gd`, `playtest_end_detector.gd`, `unfocused_*.gd` |
| `scene/` | `scene_lease.gd` + the public scene types | `undo_redo_helpers.gd`, `signal_pair_resolver.gd` |
| `security/` | — | `audit`, `auth`, `file_guard`, `scrubber`, `untrusted` |
| `paths/` | `project_paths.gd` | `project_key`, `user_path_monitor`, `lsp_publisher` |
| `logging/` | — | `log_buffer`, `log_helpers` |
| `versioning/` | `mcp_version_utils.gd` | `nodejs_check`, `stale_instance_hint` |
| `runtime/` | `mcp_runtime_server.gd` (the runtime autoload) | — |

`plugin.gd` is a thin orchestrator: lifecycle (`_enter_tree`/`_exit_tree`/`_enable_plugin`/
`_disable_plugin`) delegating composition to `core/plugin_composer.gd`.

## B3. Contract bindings

- The dispatch **contract** value types live under `contract/` —
  `MCPToolkitError`/`MCPToolkitSuccess`/`MCPToolkitToolContext`/`MCPToolkitCommandOptions`
  plus the shared `contract/coerce.gd` coercion path.
- Command modules expose the
  [§8.11](#811-static-func-utility-modules) entry point:
  `static func register(registry: MCPToolkitCommandRegistry, server: Node) -> void` (e.g.
  `commands/asset_commands.gd:27`, `commands/folder_commands.gd`), invoked from the composer so
  one place sees the full command surface.
- Per [§5.10](#510-relocating-stripped-rationale), this repo's decision records live in
  `docs/adr/` (not shipped; the next ADR number is `max(existing) + 1`); the narrative trail for
  a stripped comment relocates to the commit message or an ADR.
- *Optional companions:* a tool/term reference (`docs/dev/contract.md`) and a glossary
  (`docs/dev/glossary.md`) accompany this standard when present — align public names and contract
  shapes to them.

## B4. Canonical exemplars

The in-tree examples a reviewer or contributor jumps to. Line numbers drift; the symbol name is
the durable anchor.

**Comments / docs ([§5](#5-comments-and-documentation)).** The nine public classes (B1) are the
exemplary public-API docs. `commands/editor_helpers.gd` documents dict-shaped return contracts on
its cross-module `static func` helpers (5.11.3). `contract/mcp_toolkit_command_options.gd`
(`with_min_godot_version`) shows the brief / blank-`##` / detail shape with `[param]` prose
(5.11.6–5.11.7).

**Preload aggregator ([§6](#6-preloads-class_name-and-the-preload-aggregator)).**
`core/modules.gd:8-23` (the `const Name := preload(...)` set); the cycle-avoidance note at
`commands/editor_helpers.gd:8` ("preloaded by `core/modules.gd`, so it CANNOT import
`core/modules.gd`").

**Cohesion ([§7](#7-design-solid-cohesion-and-decomposition)).** `plugin.gd` (orchestrator) +
`core/plugin_composer.gd` (composition); `transport/mcp_server.gd` (orchestrator) +
`transport/dispatch/`; the folder topology table in B2 is the worked example of 7.8.

**`@tool` universality ([§8.1](#81-universal-tool)).** All 113 addon `.gd` files begin with
`@tool`.

**Editor/runtime static split ([§8.2](#82-editorruntime-split-by-the-static-dependency-graph-not-runtime-branches)).**
`runtime/mcp_runtime_server.gd:18-31` — the runtime autoload preloads only export-clean scripts
(`contract/coerce`, `security/{untrusted,auth,scrubber}`, `logging/{log_helpers,log_buffer}`,
`registry/registry_client`, `transport/{notifier,ws_transport}`, `scene/signal_pair_resolver`)
and **deliberately not** `core/modules.gd` (which statically names `EditorInterface`/
`EditorPlugin`), with the `godot#91713` rationale inline.

**Cross-version gating ([§8.3](#83-cross-version-compatibility)).** Version comparisons centralize
in `versioning/mcp_version_utils.gd` (`is_at_least:35`, `is_at_most:39`, `is_version_in_range:43`).
`has_method` gates: `EditorInterface.has_method("close_scene")` (4.5+) at
`commands/editor_helpers.gd:463` and `commands/folder_commands.gd:91,108`;
`has_method("get_editor_toaster")` (4.4+) at `core/editor_access.gd:43`;
`has_method("get_command_palette")` at `core/tool_menu.gd:55,66`. The warn-don't-block check is at
`plugin.gd:50-56` (`VersionUtils.GODOT_TESTED_MAX_VERSION`).

**No `OS.delay_*` in handlers ([§8.4](#84-no-osdelay_msec--osdelay_usec-in-command-handlers)).**
`commands/editor_helpers.gd` uses `await Engine.get_main_loop().create_timer(...).timeout` (e.g.
`:546`, `:553`, `:573`, `:579`).

**Lifecycle + `free()` teardown ([§8.5](#85-editorplugin-lifecycle-and-teardown-symmetry),
[§8.6](#86-plugin-teardown-frees-with-free-not-queue_free)).** `plugin.gd` registers in
`_enter_tree:30` and reverses in `_exit_tree:79`; autoload via `_enable_plugin:101` /
`_disable_plugin:105`. The composer frees owned objects with `free()`:
`core/plugin_composer.gd:187` (`_dock.free()`), `:231` (`_server.free()`), and nulls
RefCounted subsystems after `remove_*` (`:220`).

**TCPServer discard ([§8.7](#87-discard--recreate-a-tcpserver-after-a-failed-listen)).**
`transport/ws_transport.gd:202` (`_tcp_server.stop()` after a failed retry) and `:368-369`
(`stop()` + null on shutdown); mirrored in the runtime server.

**Deferred + throttled I/O ([§8.8](#88-heavy-editor-io-is-deferred-and-frame-throttled)).**
`transport/mcp_server.gd:44-62` (the `godot#46893`/`#54864`/`#110891` rationale,
`_POLL_FRAME_INTERVAL := 4`) and the throttle check at `:429`.

**`send_text` return + central size guard ([§8.9](#89-check-the-send_text-return--oversized-websocket-frames-drop-wholesale)).**
`transport/notifier.gd:25` routes every response through `MCPToolkitError.guard_response_size(...)`
(the central choke-point) then checks the `send_text` return at `:26-28`; notification sends are
checked at `:52-58`.

**Custom settings ([§8.10](#810-custom-projectsettings--editorsettings)).**
`core/settings_registration.gd` — `has_setting` guards at `:88`/`:105`, `set_as_basic(...)` at
`:96`/`:108`, `add_property_info` at `:97`.

---

## B5. Paginating tools — the shared `Pagination` envelope

Any tool that caps or pages its result **builds the response through
`Modules.Pagination`** (`contract/pagination.gd`) — never a hand-rolled envelope.
The class owns the contract so every consumer shares it (ADR 0020).

**Invariants — always present:** `has_more` (bool), `total_<unit>` (exact,
walk-all), `returned` (this page's size). Never `truncated` (→ `has_more`) or a
returned-size `count` (→ `returned`); a non-paginating `count` beside no total is
fine and stays.

**Resume mechanism — pick one:**
- *Resumable* → a linear resume field (`next_offset` for index/byte, `next_start_line`
  for line), emitted only when `has_more`, plus a `hint`.
- *Cursor-less* (walk not linearly resumable) → **no** resume field; document the
  in-tool navigation axis (`path_prefix`+filters, or `region`+`bounds`) in the
  `hint`. The integer resume field is a "resume field", not a "cursor".

**Families → builder method:** `list_page` (LIST), `byte_page` (CONTENT-byte),
`line_page` (CONTENT-line); spatial tools are LIST-shaped with `bounds` in `extras`
and no resume field. The generic `build()` is for a one-off shape — a third repeat
graduates into a family method.

**Clamp, don't reject:** a caller window param over the tool's per-tool max is
clamped and disclosed (`limit_clamped: true` in `extras` + a clamp clause the class
appends to `hint`); `≤ 0`/non-int is rejected. `hint` is present iff `has_more`
**or** a clamp occurred.

**No per-emitter marker comment.** The `Modules.Pagination.<family>()` call is the
discoverable contract (greppable); a comment pointing at this doc from a shipped
`addons/` file violates §8.12. The class's own header docstring is self-contained.

## Appendix — condensed review checklist

Run over **any changed `.gd` file**. The **general** rows apply to every file (addon, `test/`,
tooling). The **plugin** rows apply to **addon** files only — test scripts are exempt from those
*only* because they are not an addon.

**General — naming & structure**

- [ ] Filename `snake_case`; any new `class_name` is `MCPToolkit`-prefixed and justified, else preload-only ([§1](#1-file-folder-and-symbol-naming), [§6](#6-preloads-class_name-and-the-preload-aggregator))
- [ ] Identifiers: PascalCase types, snake_case funcs/vars, CONSTANT_CASE consts, `_`-prefix for private ([§1.2](#1-file-folder-and-symbol-naming))
- [ ] Names intent-revealing, spelled-out, disambiguated; signals past-tense / event-natural ([§1.4](#1-file-folder-and-symbol-naming), [§1.5](#15-names-are-intent-revealing-unambiguous-and-spelled-out))
- [ ] Members in canonical declaration order; inner classes last unless type-before-use forces earlier ([§2](#2-mandatory-declaration-order))

**General — formatting, typing, comments**

- [ ] Tabs; 2-level arg / 1-level collection continuation; one statement per line; two blank lines between funcs; trailing commas; `and`/`or`/`not`; double quotes ([§3](#3-formatting))
- [ ] Every func has typed params + return type; `:=` when obvious, explicit type for dynamic/`Variant`/`get()`/`call()`; no typed `Dictionary[K,V]`; no `as` for validation ([§4](#4-static-typing))
- [ ] Comments carry *why* / contract / hazard, not *what*; no process history, author tags, or caller rosters; load-bearing public refs kept as intent + constraint ([§5.1](#51-core-principle--intent-the-why-never-history)–[§5.6](#56-anti-patterns-delete-on-sight))
- [ ] `##` class docstring after `extends`; cross-module helpers document return shape; brief / blank-`##` / detail; `[param]` + "Returns …" prose; BBCode floored to 4.2 (plain `[codeblock]`, no 4.3+ tags); bare `@deprecated`/`@experimental` ([§5.11](#511-the-gdscript--godot-doc-comment-layer))
- [ ] TODO/FIXME actionable + tracked; no secrets, internal-only URLs/paths; SPDX header not per-file blurb ([§5.7](#57-todo--fixme-and-friends), [§5.8](#58-open-source-hygiene-comments-are-public))
- [ ] No dict shape / validation / decision logic duplicated ≥ 2× — extract one helper (rule of three) ([§7.4](#7-design-solid-cohesion-and-decomposition))

**Plugin (addon files only)**

- [ ] File has **one** statable responsibility (no "and"); over-broad files use orchestrator + SRP-children; children born in the right folder; commands vs queries separated ([§7.1](#7-design-solid-cohesion-and-decomposition)–[§7.8](#7-design-solid-cohesion-and-decomposition))
- [ ] Internal scripts via `preload` const through the aggregator; no `class_name` leakage; no aggregator cycle; stateless helpers `static func`; command modules expose `register(registry, server)` ([§6](#6-preloads-class_name-and-the-preload-aggregator), [§8.11](#811-static-func-utility-modules))
- [ ] Every `add_*` has a reverse-order `remove_*`; autoload via `_enable/_disable_plugin`; owned controls freed; signals disconnected; GDScript-2.0 connect syntax; custom settings guarded + `set_as_basic` + scrubbed on uninstall (prefix-scan, prompt before erasing machine-wide) ([§8.5](#85-editorplugin-lifecycle-and-teardown-symmetry), [§8.10](#810-custom-projectsettings--editorsettings))
- [ ] `@tool` on the file; if runtime-shipped, zero editor-only class names anywhere in its preload graph ([§8.1](#81-universal-tool), [§8.2](#82-editorruntime-split-by-the-static-dependency-graph-not-runtime-branches))
- [ ] Version-gated calls use `has_method()` + `call()`; no `Callable` formed from a bare static-method reference (4.2 binds it to a NIL `self` → silent abort + typed-default return); compares go through the version utility; teardown frees with `free()` (RefCounted subsystems just null'd); failed `TCPServer.listen()` → `stop()` + null + fresh instance; listener/scene I/O stays deferred + throttled; response sends check `send_text` + central size-guard ([§8.3](#83-cross-version-compatibility)–[§8.9](#89-check-the-send_text-return--oversized-websocket-frames-drop-wholesale))
- [ ] `plugin.cfg` only the documented fields; folder id unchanged; shipped files reference no unshipped paths; `.uid`/`.import` sidecars shipped, never stripped or git-ignored ([§8.12](#812-asset-library-shipping-hygiene))
- [ ] Any `OS.shell_open` / OS handoff of a data-derived URL allowlists the scheme (http/https) ([§8.13](#813-validate-a-data-derived-urls-scheme-before-osshell_open))
